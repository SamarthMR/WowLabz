Machine learning is one of the hottest new technologies to emerge into popular consciousness in the last decade, transforming fields from consumer electronics and healthcare to retail. This has led to intense curiosity about this field among many students and working professionals about the field.

Simply put, machine learning is a set of statistical techniques and algorithms designed to find and use structure and patterns in data to make interesting predictions or provide cool insights. Organizations use machine learning for all kinds of applications: whether it’s translating text from one language to another, detecting obstacles in front of self-driving cars or for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.

If you’re a tech professional such as a software developer, business analyst or even a product manager, you might be curious about how machine learning can change they way you work and take your career to the next level. However, as a busy professional, you’re also looking for a way to get a solid understanding of machine learning that’s not only rigorous and practical, but also concise and fast.
